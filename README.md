# CS_340_database_group_project
This repo is for our CS 340 portfolio database project using Flask/Python and MySQL.

The purpose of this web app is to enable users to interact with the exercise database using CRUD functionality.

TODO:
- Change the drop downs in Exercises form to include only the values in the respective tables that already exist
- Change insert queries to not insert into other tables, but reference the selected value from the dropdown
- implement update functionality (same as guide with new route)
- implement delete functionality (same as guide)
